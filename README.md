# Check for REAL and FAKE News

## Description:
This project aims to create a simple demonstration application for utilizing GenerativeAI's Large Language Models (LLM) to check wheather the given input news is REAL or FAKE. The application further executes these queries on a SQLite database, and stores the users input and output.

## Expected Outcome:
By the end of the project, users should be able to interact with the application by providing natural language descriptions of their querying needs. The application, powered by GenerativeAI's Gemini model, should be able to generate accurate output based on these descriptions, and present the data back to the user.
